- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrej Batarilo
- 👀 I’m mosly interested in backend development. I like to play around with microservices written in Reactive Spring and Node.js. 
I usually write my frontend in AngularJS/Typescript. I also do a bit of Android development in Kotlin.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my Spring Framework and Android skills. Also working on some Ethereum dapps (decentralized applications).
- 💞️ I’m looking to develop REST API according to your needs.
- 📫 You can reach me at: batarilocore@gmail.com
